Hello there, this is a program designed to show the versatility of strings, this program might be basic to a lot, but, it is creative, and it also shows talents in places we dont know, so, lets appreciate it.
This program only has just three operations it could do, addition, subtraction and multiplication.
When the program starts to run, it asks the user for the number of digits it intends to perform operations with, and then, the user presses enter, and begins to put his question.
Because of how the program is structured, after each term in the question, one space is required before it works perfectly. 
A demonstration is this: I intend to add two numbers, 24 and 25, When the program asks me the number of digits, I put 2 (for 24 and 25), and then, I would press enter, and start my operation, when inputing my numbers, consider the following examples of putting it in: 24+25 --> This illustration is not correct, an error would be generated, or it wont work perfectly. 24 + 25 --> This is the right way, after this, press enter, it would give u the result.
Likewise for multiplication and subtraction, I'm also trying to adapt it to do division too.
I didnt comment the code though, which i think is really bad, but pls just look at the creative spirit behind this, not my coding etiquette.
